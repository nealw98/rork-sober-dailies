    content: `As I begin this day, I ask my Higher Power:
Direct my thinking and remove from me self-centered fear and selfish motives. Help me walk with clarity, courage, and purpose.

When I don’t know what to do, grant me inspiration. Give me an intuitive thought, a gentle nudge, or the patience to wait. Teach me to trust that Your guidance will come.

Help me relax and take it easy. Keep me from forcing outcomes or trying to run the show. Let me remember that I’m not in charge — You are.

As I go about my day, show me the next right action. Give me what I need to handle whatever comes my way.

Remove my fear. Direct my attention to what You would have me be. Give me faith in Your plan and the courage to act.

Remove my selfishness and self-centeredness. Direct my thinking toward others. Show me how I can be of service — useful, kind, and willing.

Thy will, not mine, be done. Amen.`,

Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!",

    title: "Eleventh Step Prayer",
    content: `Lord, make me a channel of thy peace;

that where there is hatred, I may bring love;

that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness;

that where there is discord, I may bring harmony;

that where there is error, I may bring truth;

that where there is doubt, I may bring faith;

that where there is despair, I may bring hope;

that where there are shadows, I may bring light;

that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.

Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted;
to understand, than to be understood; to love, than to be loved.

For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.
It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.

Amen.`,

    title: "Serenity Prayer (Long Form)",
    content: "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\n\nLiving one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; taking this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it; trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His Will; that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely useful to God and my fellow beings.",

    title: "Evening Prayer",
    content: `As this day closes, I thank my Higher Power for the gifts, lessons, and people You placed in my path today, and for the strength to stay sober and the moments of grace I noticed.

I look honestly at my day and ask forgiveness for the times I was selfish, afraid, or unkind. Place on my heart any amends I need to make, and give me the willingness.

I release tonight every worry, resentment, and fear of tomorrow, and ask You to grant me restful sleep that restores body, mind, and spirit.

Guide my thoughts and actions tomorrow that they may align with Your will, helping me grow in usefulness to others.

With gratitude and trust, I place myself in Your care, one day at a time.

Amen.`,
