    content: "As I begin this day, I ask my Higher Power: God, direct my thinking today so that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonesty, self-will, self-seeking and fear. God, inspire my thinking, decisions and intuitions. Help me to relax and take it easy. Free me from doubt and indecision. Guide me through this day and show me my next step. God, show me what I need to do to take care of any problems. I ask all these things that I may be of maximum service to you and my fellow man.",

    title: "Third Step Prayer",
    content: "God, I offer myself to Theeâ€”to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!",

    title: "Seventh Step Prayer",
    content: "My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad. I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding. Amen.",

  {
    title: "Eleventh Step Prayer",
    content: `Lord, make me a channel of thy peace;
that where there is hatred, I may bring love;
that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness;
that where there is discord, I may bring harmony;
that where there is error, I may bring truth;
that where there is doubt, I may bring faith;
that where there is despair, I may bring hope;
that where there are shadows, I may bring light;
that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.

Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted;
to understand, than to be understood;
to love, than to be loved.

For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.
It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.

Amen.`,

    title: "Serenity Prayer (Long Form)",
    content: "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\n\nLiving one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; taking this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it; trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His Will; that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely useful to God and my fellow beings.",

    title: "Sick Man Prayer",

  {
    title: "Evening Prayer",
    content: "As this day closes: God, I constructively review my day. Was I resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid? Do I owe an apology? Have I kept something to myself which should be discussed with another person at once? Was I kind and loving toward all? What could I have done better? Was I thinking of myself most of the time? Or was I thinking of what I could do for others, of what I could pack into the stream of life? I ask God to forgive me where I have been wrong and to guide me to right actions tomorrow.",
