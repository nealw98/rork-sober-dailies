// Orientation policy, in one place (Neal, 2026-11-06: the unfolded Duo must
// rotate with the device).
//
// The rule: phone-class displays stay portrait — that includes every regular
// iPhone and the Duo's cover screen — while tablet-class displays (the Duo's
// unfolded inner screen, iPad) rotate freely so the app follows how the
// device is held. "Tablet-class" = the display's SHORT side is at least
// 600pt, the same threshold the wide layouts use (hooks/useLayoutMode).
//
// app.json orientation is "default" (the native shell allows landscape); this
// runtime lock/unlock is what actually governs on phones. The inner display
// is different, and everything in steerToLandscape below exists because of
// three facts confirmed across Apple's Duo tech talk, Apple DTS answers,
// Unity's SDK-27 testing, and the fold-handoff fixes in other projects
// (Usernode-Labs/flutter-mobile-app#636, react-native-orientation-director#116):
//   1. Unfolding emits NO device-rotation event. iOS rotates apps on rotation
//      events, so the cover screen's portrait is carried over and simply
//      stays, even though the inner display would rotate freely.
//   2. The inner display refuses programmatic orientation changes
//      ("the current windowing mode does not allow…") and ignores the app's
//      declared orientation masks. The ONLY nudge that still lands is the
//      synthesized device-rotation that expo-screen-orientation's lockAsync
//      sends natively — and only once the fold transition has settled, which
//      takes an unpredictable amount of time.
//   3. expo's unlockAsync re-asserts the CURRENT orientation natively. Called
//      while the handoff is still stuck in portrait, it actively re-pins
//      portrait. So while a handoff is unresolved we must never unlock; we
//      hold the landscape-only lock and keep nudging until the window has
//      actually turned, then unlock for free rotation.
// The previous version gave the steer one 2.5-second shot and then unlocked
// regardless — when iOS settled slower than that, the unlock re-pinned
// portrait and every later trigger kept re-pinning it (Neal, 2026-11-06:
// "worked a couple times but then not"). Now the steer is a bounded
// retry loop driven by the same triggers, and it only ends in unlock once
// landscape has landed or the window expires into free rotation.
//
// Triggers that re-apply the rule (any single one can be missed, so all run):
//   · Dimensions change — the normal foreground fold/unfold signal, plus a
//     delayed re-assert because events during the transition can be dropped;
//   · AppState active — a fold/unfold that happens while the app is
//     backgrounded delivers no Dimensions event at all;
//   · SideInsetGuard onLayout — the root view re-laying out.
// Guarded require: binaries without the native module (≤126) reject the
// calls — they're natively portrait-locked anyway, so this is a no-op there.
