Subject: API Still Returning 500 Error Even with Minimal Payload

Hi,

Following your suggestion, I tested with progressively smaller payloads:

### Test Results:

**1. Minimal "ping" test:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "You are Steady Eddie, a compassionate AA sponsor offering supportive guidance.\n\nUser: Hello"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Payload size: ~150 characters
- Result: **500 Internal Server Error**

**2. Even our smallest possible request fails:**
- Single user message
- ~200 total bytes
- Still getting 500 error

### Error Details:
- **Status**: 500
- **Response Body**: `Internal Server Error` (plain text)
- **Headers**: 
  ```
  content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
  server: cloudflare
  x-do-orig-status: 500
  ```

### What This Tells Us:
Since even **minimal payloads fail**, this is not a size issue. The endpoint itself appears to be having internal errors processing **any** request.

### Request Format Being Used:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "[short prompt]\n\nUser: [message]"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Questions:
1. Can you check server-side logs for the `/text/llm/` endpoint?
2. Is the endpoint currently operational?
3. Has anything changed recently on the server?
4. Is there authentication or rate limiting I'm missing?

### Project Info:
- **App**: Sober Dailies (iOS)
- **Endpoint**: `https://toolkit.rork.com/text/llm/`
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`

This appears to be a server-side issue that needs your backend team to investigate. Happy to provide any additional logs or details you need!

Thanks,
Neal
