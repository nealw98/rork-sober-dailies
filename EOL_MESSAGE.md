# Important Update About Sober Dailies

Thank you for being part of our recovery community.

This is the final update for the free version of Sober Dailies. To continue supporting development and adding new features, we're transitioning to a paid model.

## The paid version includes:

• All current features you love  
• Future updates and improvements  
• Continued support  
• Same great AA resources

Your sobriety journey matters to us. The new app is available on the Play Store for a one-time purchase.

**Keep coming back. It works if you work it.**
